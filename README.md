# Inventory-Control
Simple inventory control system, with options to add, list, check prices, and product availability.

I created this small system with the intention of building a simple yet scalable inventory control. It's possible to improve the filters and options according to the need, just by adding the option to the list that the options function receives as a parameter and creating the new function to meet the requirement.

I have been programming in Python since the beginning of March 2023, and currently, it's June 23, 2023. So please take this information into account when judging the code, as I know there is still a lot of room for optimization, but I consider it a great achievement already.

I will continue studying and sharing new projects. Follow me to keep up with my journey.
